## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla CSS and HTML only

### What I learned

I found that the Figma files were useful in understanding the flex model. Viewing things as boxes within boxes, or groups within groups, was a useful way to approach this task.

### Continued development

This task did not require any responsiveness, so I think some of the values I hard coded would not work.

I should work on getting more proficient with positioning things in a reactive way. However, this might be an easier task with a library.
